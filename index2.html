                <h2>Me & Coding</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello, my name is Richard Zhang. Currently, my goal is to become a full-stack developer, and then
                    eventually
                    branch out into other programming-related fields. My educational
                    background is in forensic science and nursing. I
                    finished my forensic science degree in 2017. I worked for two years in a media company after that.
                    Now, I'm heading into my fourth year of nursing in the Fall of 2022. Since I started learning about
                    programming a few months ago, I've found that I really enjoy coding. So depending on how things go,
                    I may decide to switch to programming full-time! <br><br>
                    I don't have a formal background in programming or computer science, and I haven't dedicated myself
                    to trying to learn these things on my own before learning of this bootcamp. However, I did spend a
                    year and a half in a Java course in high-school (which was over ten years ago). I also learned a bit
                    about HTML and CSS in a design elective during my forensic science program. Most recently, I took a
                    statistics course and the professor had as coding in LaTeX to create PDF documents. I really wish I
                    looked into programming earlier, because I've been really liking learning how to code.
